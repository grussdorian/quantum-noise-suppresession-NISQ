## Noise reduction with the help of padding with U and V gates.

Testing the effect of padding of unitaries $U$ and $V$ on every qubit. 

circuit will look like this:

Parameters which are variable for a given circuit is $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$

and those parameters are varied for circuits with gates $U,V \in \{R_x,R_y,R_z\}$

And fidelity is calculated and plotted against the baseline (without padding with unitaries)

## Results

## For 5 qubits with different $\theta$ parameters

Here we have 5 different parameters for $U$, they are $\theta_{1},\theta_{2},\theta_{3},\theta_{4}$ and $\theta_{5}$.

And the circuit $V$ is just $U^{â€ }$.
